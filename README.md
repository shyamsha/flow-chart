### Problem statement

#### Files

- index.html
- src/index.js (app file)
- src/components (where the components reside)

#### Build

Build a multi select drop down component using using a combination of div,span,ul & li.

Presentation

- The component should support label and value as a typical select component would do
- Display a list of items from which the user can select one or more values
- Highlight the selected items
- Build essential plumbing to broadcast the selected values to the parent component under which this is being used

Brownie Points

- Make the drop down work in single or multi-select mode by passing down a flag
- Show the list of items selected in the form of removable chips

Implementation

- Logic and styling to be implemented using plain javascript/ JSX and CSS
- Code to be checked in back to the same repository

Stack

- react
- parcel (install from https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html)
- nodejs & npm (download & install from https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/)

Run

- `npm run start` - Parcel will start a live reload server at port 1234 and take care of build & bundling
